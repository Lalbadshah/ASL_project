We Created a hand pose dataset to use hand pose images as data input to train different algorithms and then use separate image data to test the performance of the algorithms with respect to classification and recognition accuracy. Approach involved testing appropriate segmentation techniques (KMeans, PCA, LDA) and then attempting classification using a Linear Gaussian Classifier
